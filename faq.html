                                Why a pop-up journal rather than a special issue?
                            </div>
                            <div class="faq-answer">
                                <p>A pop-up journal's primary goal is to answer a specific, well-scoped question, rather than to assemble thematically related research. Accordingly, they have some unusual features:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Accessible synthesis essays attempting to answer the question based on available evidence</li>
                                        <li>Best guess estimates of quantitative answers to the question, with confidence intervals</li>
                                        <li>Publication of work that is not typically published in conventional journals, like replication studies and descriptions of new datasets</li>
                                        <li>Identification of important evidence gaps and proactive efforts to spur new research to fill them</li>
                                    </ul>
                                <p>Importantly, pop-up journals also recur over the course of several years. This enables researchers to conceive and execute original research projects with the goal of eventual inclusion in a pop-up journal issue; by contrast, special issues of traditional journals usually have a timeframe short enough that researchers need to have been working on the topic already in order to submit. Pop-up journals' recurrence also allows for the integration of new evidence into expert syntheses and best-guess answers, which provides a transparent window into how the state of knowledge is advancing over time.</p>
                                <p>In general, we believe this model better aligns incentives to reduce uncertainty and provide actionable answers to the policymakers and decision-makers that need them.</p>
