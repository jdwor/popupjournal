                        <h2>The Griliches Question: What is the return on investment of R&D?</h2>
                        <p>The first research challenge to be tackled by a pop-up journal is to estimate the return on
                            investment (ROI) associated with research and development (R&D) activities.</p>

                        <p>The importance of this question &mdash; sometimes referred to as "<a
                                href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/3003321?origin=crossref" target="_blank">the
                                Griliches Question</a>" &mdash; has been recognized since Harvard Professor Zvi
                            Griliches began his pioneering studies of innovation in the 1950s. Developing a better
                            understanding of the answer could be hugely important for developing policies to increase
                            growth and productivity.</p>

                        <p>Today, for example, the US government spends a little over 0.6% of GDP, or 60 cents out of
                            every $100 produced in the country, on scientific and technological R&D. It does so because
                            it believes the fruits of that research are sufficiently valuable to justify spending. But
                            there is little consensus on how large these benefits are. Are we getting $2 in benefits for
                            every $1 we invest? Or is it more like $20?</p>

                        <p>Since published assessments of the ROI on R&D vary widely, the initiative's funders are
                            challenging researchers to converge on more trustworthy estimates by working together in new
                            ways. Many pieces of evidence may need to be examined and assembled in order to arrive at a
                            satisfying picture of R&D's effects on the economy. Experts who start out with a variety of
                            different expectations about ROI values will, ideally, find more and more consensus, both on
                            the range of possible answers and how those answers depend on specific contexts and
                            assumptions.</p>

                        <p>Refinements on the Griliches Question may concern, for example:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Average versus marginal ROI</li>
                            <li>Government versus private sector ROI</li>
                            <li>Short- versus long-term ROI</li>
                            <li>National versus global benefits</li>
                            <li>Effects on GDP versus health gains or broader measures of social welfare</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Regarding this last point, the initial emphasis of our initiative will be on economic
                            estimates of direct concern to decisionmakers &mdash; though we appreciate that this hardly
                            captures all the considerations that ought to play a role in making R&D investments.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Host an annual research conference in Washington, D.C. exploring unresolved aspects
                                of estimating the returns to R&D</li>
                            <li>Commission original research papers advancing our understanding of R&D returns</li>

                            interactive digital features, methodological refinements, and preliminary findings. Because
                            its primary value lies in organizing and presenting progress on answering the question, the

                            is seeking to support primary research that can help develop consensus estimates
                            of the return on investments in research and development (R&D). This coordinated
                            call aims to spur rigorous, empirical studies that can narrow the range of existing
                            estimates and inform public and private R&D investment decisions.</p>

                        <p>In addition, there are several other funders who have historically supported research
                            related to the Griliches Question, including:</p>

                        <p>These organizations will apply their own independent procedures and criteria concerning

                        <p>Coefficient Giving is a philanthropic funder and advisor. Since our founding, we've directed
                            over $4 billion in grants as part of our mission to help others as much as we can with the
                            resources available to us. We invest an unusual amount of effort in selecting causes where
                            philanthropic funding can have outsized leverage, and aim to balance evidence-based giving
                            with ambitious bets on transformative opportunities.</p>
                        <p>We work with a range of donors who share our commitment to cost-effective, high-impact
                            giving; if you're interested in exploring how we can help maximize the impact of your
                            philanthropy, we invite you to <a href="mailto:partnerwithus@coefficientgiving.org">connect
