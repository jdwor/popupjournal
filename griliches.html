                        <h2>The Griliches Question: What is the return on investment in R&D?</h2>
                        <p>The first research challenge to be tackled by a pop-up journal is to estimate the return on
                            investment (ROI) associated with research and development (R&D) activities.</p>

                        <p>The importance of this question &mdash; sometimes referred to as "<a
                                href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/3003321?origin=crossref" target="_blank">the
                                Griliches Question</a>" &mdash; has been recognized since Harvard Professor Zvi
                            Griliches began his pioneering studies of innovation in the 1950s. Developing a better
                            understanding of the answer could be hugely important for developing policies to increase
                            growth and productivity.</p>

                        <p>Today, for example, the US government spends a little over 0.6% of GDP, or 60 cents out of
                            every $100 produced in the country, on scientific and technological R&D. It does so because
                            it believes the fruits of that research are sufficiently valuable to justify spending. But
                            there is little consensus on how large these benefits are. Are we getting $2 in benefits for
                            every $1 we invest? Or is it more like $20?</p>

                        <p>Since published assessments of the ROI on R&D vary widely, the initiative's funders are
                            challenging researchers to converge on more trustworthy estimates by working together in new
                            ways. Many pieces of evidence may need to be examined and assembled in order to arrive at a
                            satisfying picture of R&D's effects on the economy. Experts who start out with a variety of
                            different expectations about ROI values will, ideally, find more and more consensus, both on
                            the range of possible answers and how those answers depend on specific contexts and
                            assumptions.</p>

                        <p>Refinements on the Griliches Question may concern, for example:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Average versus marginal ROI</li>
                            <li>Government versus private sector ROI</li>
                            <li>Short- versus long-term ROI</li>
                            <li>National versus global benefits</li>
                            <li>Effects on GDP versus health gains or broader measures of social welfare</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Regarding this last point, the initial emphasis of our initiative will be on economic
                            estimates of direct concern to decisionmakers &mdash; though we appreciate that this hardly
                            captures all the considerations that ought to play a role in making R&D investments.</p>

                        <h2>The Pop-Up Journal</h2>

                        <p>The Griliches Question pop-up journal will be curated by a host organization and guided by a
                            Steering Committee of prominent scholars and decisionmakers. Together, they will curate
                            research on this question, help researchers coordinate their work, and communicate progress
                            in each issue.</p>

                        <div class="highlight-box">

                        <p>The journal is planned as a multi-year effort. Each annual issue will bring together several
                            key elements:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Commissioned and carefully selected research papers advancing our understanding of R&D
                            </li>
                            <li>An accessible review essay synthesizing the state of knowledge for non-specialists,
                                including policymakers</li>
                            <li>Expert elicitation tracking how estimates of the answer are evolving over time</li>
                            <li>An annual conference convening researchers and decisionmakers to discuss progress</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>The journal may also include previously published work (with appropriate context),
                            interactive digital features, methodological refinements, and preliminary findings. Because
                            its primary value lies in organizing and presenting progress on answering the question, the
                            journal will not only publish original research but will also draw on relevant results
                            published in traditional outlets.</p>

                        <p>In recognition of the importance of the Griliches Question, a consortium of research funders
                            has expressed interest in supporting research that can rigorously contribute to developing
                            consensus estimates of the return on R&D investments. This consortium includes the following
                            organizations, as well as other public and private funders domestic and abroad:</p>
